A new version of the EasyAndFastGUI v2.0 library for creating graphical interfaces has been released!

This library contains the necessary set of elements that can be used when developing MQL-applications with a graphical interface.

In the second version of this library, many improvements have been added, and bugs have been fixed that began to appear after changes in the MQL language. All articles in the series from the list below can be read only for the purpose of learning the MQL language, since the latest version has significant changes and differences.



What's new?

All images for GUI elements have been digitized and now there is no need for a folder with pictures. You can download the archive of pictures from the old version if you need a custom set of pictures for work.
Significant improvement in event stream handling. In the previous version, there was a noticeable delay if there were a lot of elements. Now everything works very fast with any number of elements.
Added the ability to change the color scheme of the GUI. In this version, it is possible to quickly switch between light and dark themes while a ready-made MQL application is running.
Integrated a new element (C3DBase) from the standard library (CCanvas3D) for working with three-dimensional graphics.
The structure of folders and library files has changed. Now all files are categorized.
The second version comes with a ready-to-use MT4 version.
All elements have methods for quick creation. Almost all elements with default parameters can now be created in just one line of code.
In addition, many other changes were made regarding the internal structure and additional refactoring of the code was made.
All comments in the code are translated into English.
The library comes with ready-made examples of graphical interfaces to make it easier for you to learn everything and get started faster.
